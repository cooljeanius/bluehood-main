<img src="https://github.com/cooljeanius/bluehood-main/blob/master/img/twiverse/default.png"><br>
A universal game community on Twitter. <br>
<br>

## Warning
These directions are outdated and have probably stopped working; sorry about that...

## Dependencies
BlueHood requires the following dependencies to be installed to work:
<ul>
  <li>Apache 2</li>
  <li>PHP 5.6 (Yes, it's an old version)</li>
  <li>MySQL</li>
  <li>An email client (e.g. Postfix)</li>
  <li>An administrative Twitter account</li>
  <li>GNU autotools, including gettext (for development)</li>
</ul>

## Installation
<p>(1) Prepare 3 Twitter applications for running BlueHood in your administrative Twitter account.</p>
<p>(2) Place <tt>twiverse.php</tt> in <tt>/var/www/</tt>, edit its contents and set its settings. </p>
<p>(3) Import <tt>mysql_struct.txt</tt> into BlueHood's MySQL database. </p>

Please contact BlueHood's original developer at (<a href="https://twitter.com/hata6502">@hata6502</a> (formerly `@Bluehood_admin`)) on Twitter, because building the development environment can be very difficult.
